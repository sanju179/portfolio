export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I'm an undergraduate student, currently pursuing my B.tech in Information Technology, graduating in 2025. I've done several interesting projects in Python. Dabbling with the 'why's' and 'how's' of the way things are allows me to never procrastinate.
                So, this is me working out a portfolio site to answer "Why do I do tech?" and "How do I improve doing tech?". Enjoy your walkthrough and feel free to reach out for questions and opportunities!`;
